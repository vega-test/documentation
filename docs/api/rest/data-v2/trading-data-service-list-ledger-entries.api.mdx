title: "List ledger entries"
description: "Get a list of ledger entries within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series - implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs - with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Each account filter must contain no more than one party ID.

Entries can be filtered by:
  - the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - sending AND receiving account
  - transfer type either in addition to the above filters or as a standalone option"

## List ledger entries



Get a list of ledger entries within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series - implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs - with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Each account filter must contain no more than one party ID.

Entries can be filtered by:
  - the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - sending AND receiving account
  - transfer type either in addition to the above filters or as a standalone option

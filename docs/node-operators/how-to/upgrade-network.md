The protocol upgrade feature allows the nodes running a network to automatically update to the latest version of the Vega protocol, without requiring manual intervention. This can be particularly useful in situations where the protocol is critical to the functioning of the system and any downtime or disruption needs to be minimised.

Protocol upgrades can be done using Vega Visor, a process runner that manages the the processes of a Vega validator node and a data node. Visor starts and stops node processes, tells the node when to take a snapshot, and coordinates upgrades to the protocol.

Alternatively, a validator node operator can manually upgrade the protocol at an agreed block height, for an agreed Vega software version.

A protocol upgrade involves two main parts: 
* Submitting a transaction to initiate the upgrade on a specific block
* Using a process manager, Vega Visor, to coordinate the rollout of the upgrade, or manually upgrading at the agreed block height

## Using Visor to coordinate upgrades
If an upgrade proposal is approved (more than 2/3 of consensus validators have voted on the proposal), those using Visor can rely on it to coordinate the rollout of the upgrade across all the nodes on the chosen block height. 

This includes stopping the currently running nodes, ensuring that the new binaries are the correct software version, and starting new nodes. Visor also includes features such as restart capability, which allows Visor to retry the start-up several times before failing. 

You can configure the number of restart attempts in the Visor config, located at `VISOR_HOME_PATH/config.toml`

### Read more about Visor
Read detailed information about Vega Visor, including how it works, how the config is set up and how you can edit it in the [full software description ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/tree/develop/visor#readme).

You can also read the [architecture overview ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/tree/develop/visor#architecture) and [upgrade flow ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/tree/develop/visor#upgrade-flow) topics in the Visor readme.

## API endpoints to help with protocol upgrades
The data node exposes endpoints for a protocol upgrade. You can use them to see the number of proposals submitted and the protocol upgrade status for the network.

To see proposals submitted for a protocol upgrade, use the **[protocol upgrade proposals](../../api/rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-list-protocol-upgrade-proposals.api.mdx) endpoint**.

To see if the network is ready for a protocol upgrade, use the **[protocol upgrade status](../../api/rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-get-protocol-upgrade-status.api.mdx) endpoint**.

## Protocol upgrade procedure: step by step

### 1. Select upgrade block height and new Vega version
This step is async and it involves all validators. First, all validators have to agree on the following:

* The block height to upgrade at
* The Vega version to upgrade to

The block height must be in the future. When choosing the `upgrade block`, you should give all validators enough time to vote on the upgrade and then prepare config for a new network.

:::info Example
If you select the `current block` + 1000 - it should give you 1000 blocks * 1.5 seconds (or whatever the average block time is) = 1500 secs. That means you may have about 25 minutes, which may not be enough time for all of the validators to vote and prepare config.

To predict the time that you allow for other validators to prepare configs and vote, check the block time on the network. To do that, visit the `http://<YOUR-NODE-IP>:3003/statistics` endpoint. When there are no transactions, the block time is about 1.5 seconds max, though it may be lower, for example, 0.8 seconds.

### 2. Perform manual steps required for upgrade

#### a. Vote for an upgrade
All of the validators must execute this step, regardless of whether or not you are running Vega Visor.

After all the validators agree on `upgrade block height` and the `desired version` of Vega, vote on an upgrade. To vote, use the following command:

```bash
vega protocol_upgrade_proposal \
	--home <VEGA-NETWORK-HOME> \
	--passphrase-file <NODE-WALLET-PASSPHRASE-FILE> \
	--vega-release-tag <VEGA-TAG-YOU-AGREED-ON> \
	--height <BLOCK-HEIGHT-YOU-AGREED-ON> \
	--output "json"
```

Example:

```bash
vega protocol_upgrade_proposal \
	--home /home/vega/vega_home \
	--passphrase-file /home/vega/vega_home/nodewallet_passphrase.txt \
	--vega-release-tag v0.68.2 \
	--height 1034000 \
	--output "json"
```

#### b. Prepare network configuration
After you propose a protocol upgrade, prepare your configuration. 

1. The Vega core configuration (`<VEGA-NETWORK-HOME>/config/node/config.toml`)- only if there were changes
2. The Tendermint configuration (`<TENDERMINT-HOME>/config/config.toml`)  - only if there were changes
3. The data node configuration (`<VEGA-NETWORK-HOME>/config/data-node/config.toml`) - only if there were changes and you are running data-node.

Track changes in the configuration between versions in the upgrading readme: [Configuration changes ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md#configuration-changes)

You must prepare the above configs whether you are running vega with a visor or not.

### 3a. Prepare Visor configuration
You can skip to the next step if you are not running Visor.

1. Create the new version folder in the `<VEGA-VISOR-HOME>`, e.g., for version `v0.68.2`, run the following command: `mkdir -p <VEGA-VISOR-HOME>/v0.68.2`.
2. Create the run configuration and put it in the folder created in the previous point (see example below)
3. Download the new version of the Vega binary from the [releases page ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases)
4. Unzip the downloaded binary into the `<VEGA-VISOR-HOME>/v0.68.2` directory.

Example config for the new version with Visor:

```toml
name = "v0.68.2"

[vega]
  [vega.binary]
    path = "vega"
    args = [
      "start",
      "--home", "<VEGA-NETWORK-HOME>",
      "--tendermint-home", "<TENDERMINT-HOME>",
      "--nodewallet-passphrase-file", "<NODE-WALLET-PASSPHRASE-FILE-PATH>",
          ]
  [vega.rpc]
    socketPath = "<SOCKET-FOLDER-PATH>/vega.sock"
    httpPath = "/rpc"

[data_node]
  [data_node.binary]
    path = "vega"
    args = [
      "datanode", "start",
      "--home", "<VEGA-NETWORK-HOME>",
    ]
```

Check the following parameters.

- `name` - This must match to the  folder name created in `step 3a`
- `vega.binary.path` - It may be an absolute path or a relative (to config folder) path. Change that path when you have unzipped the new binary into a different folder.
- `--nodewallet-passphrase-file` flag - Check if the path is correct for your node wallet passphrase.
- `vega.rpc.socketPath` - Make sure the path to the Vega Unix sock is correct and matches the one in the Vega config.

Once you have updated your Visor run config and the network config, you have to wait for the upgrade block. Visor will listen for the upgrade event and restart your binaries. 

### 3b. Prepare upgrade if not running Visor
You should do this step only if you are not running Visor.

1. Download the new version of the Vega binary from the [releases page ↗](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vega/releases)
2. Unzip the downloaded binary into your file system.
3. Update your systemd (or any other process manager) to use the new binary.
4. Reload a systemd service: `systemctl daemon-reload`, or use your own preferred.
5. Wait for the `upgrade block`, then restart the network with the new binary and config after the `upgrade block` is present.

#### Check if Vega core is ready for restart
To see when your Vega core node is ready for protocol upgrade, check the Vega-core logs.

In the Vega core logs, you will see the following messages:

```

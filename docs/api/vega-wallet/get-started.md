Vega Wallet supports a JSON-RPC API for integrating interfaces with the Vega Wallet service, to read keys, get transaction approval, and more. The previous Wallet API has been deprecated and is no longer supported.

## Admin access
The HTTP service doesn't provide access to the `admin` endpoints, for security reasons. Actions such as creating a wallet cannot be done programmatically using the API.

## Pre-requisite
See the [Create a Wallet guide](../../tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/latest/create-wallet.md) to set up the Vega Wallet for command line. Then choose a guide below depending on your needs.

## Available APIs
The **JSON-RPC API** and its endpoint **`/api/v2/requests`** is in the alpha phase, and replaces the v1 REST API. If you discover any issues, please raise them on the [feedback board ‚Üó](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/discussions).

## Software compatibility
Vega Wallet API (v2)'s latest version was released in Vega software `v.0.68`. If you're interacting with a network on `v0.68` or newer, you'll need to have a wallet that supports the new API.

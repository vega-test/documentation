title: "Ledger entries"
description: "List ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type and transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed entries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If zero or more than one party is provided
for each of the sides - sending and receiving accounts, the query returns an error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)"

## Ledger entries



List ledger entries by asset, market, party, account type and transfer type within the given date range.
This query requests and sums the number of ledger entries from a given subset of accounts, specified via the 'filter' argument.
It returns a time series (implemented as a list of AggregateLedgerEntry structs), with a row for every time
the summed ledger entries of the set of specified accounts changes.
Listed entries should be limited to a single party from each side only. If zero or more than one party is provided
for each of the sides - sending and receiving accounts, the query returns an error.

Entries can be queried by:
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the receiving account (market ID, asset ID, account type)
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the sending AND receiving account
  - listing ledger entries with filtering on the transfer type (on top of above filters or as a standalone option)

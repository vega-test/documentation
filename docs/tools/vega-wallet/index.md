A Vega Wallet is essential for interacting with Vega, whether it's for staking or trading. The Vega Wallet apps allow you to manage wallets and key pairs, deposit and withdraw assets, stake and sign transactions.

You can interact with a Vega wallet and its keys through two different apps, or integrate using the API. 

## Vega Wallet desktop app
The **[desktop wallet](./desktop-app/index.md)** provides a visual interface to: 
* Connect to existing Vega wallet
* Create new wallet 
* Connect to networks
* Sign transactions
* Run and connect to Vega apps, such as the token dApp

## Vega Wallet CLI app
Use the **[command line app](./cli-wallet/index.md)** to do everything you can do with the desktop app, plus:
* Customise key details 
* Isolate keys
* Build and send transactions

## Vega Wallet API
Integrate with the [Vega Wallet API](../../api/vega-wallet/get-started.md) to build UIs or create other headless applications like bots or scripts.

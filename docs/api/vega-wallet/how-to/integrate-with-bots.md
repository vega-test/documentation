<Topic />

The following guide describes how to use the wallet service with bots and other headless software by creating a long-living API token. Long-living tokens are highly privileged tokens that bypass user review and the approval process. 

If using this process, be sure you are comfortable with allowing that level of access to your keys.

### Generate a long-living token

1. Enable support for long-living tokens for the wallet service, using the command below. This is only needed once, for the first time you are using long-living tokens.

```
vegawallet api-token init
```

2. Generate a token, and linked it to the wallet of your choice:

```
vegawallet api-token generate --wallet-name "WALLET_NAME" --description "for my trading bot"
```

3. Start the service with long-living token support. If you forget the `--load-tokens` flag, sessions with long-living tokens are not created.

```
vegawallet service run --load-tokens --network testnet1
```
   
### Verify the service
1. Verify the service is running with `GET /api/v2/health`
2. If it is running, verify the service exposes the JSON-RPC methods using `GET /api/v2/methods`
3. If it does expose the methods, you can start issuing requests to the wallet software with `POST /api/v2/requests`
   a. Get the chain ID of the network the wallet is connected to, to show data from the same network using `client.get_chain_id`.

### Issue a request to the service

:::caution Origin header required 
The service requires the Origin (or Referrer) HTTP header to be specified in the request. This is usually handled by the browser, so you may not have to do anything, but for software that does not use one of those headers, the request will be rejected.
:::

Use `POST /api/v2/requests` to communicate with the wallet. The request body is a JSON-RPC 2.0 payload.

1. You don't need to connect. You can use the pre-generated, long-living token in place of the regular token. The token should be specified in the `Authorization` HTTP header with the scheme `VWT`. Example: `Authorization: VWT <TOKEN>`

Use the method below to get the public keys you have access to:

```
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "client.list_keys",
      "id": "request_1"
    }
```

2. Once you have access to the key list, you can send a transaction. You will not need to get approval.

   Note, The transaction field is an example.

```
    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "method": "client.send_transaction",
      "params": {
         "publicKey": "ONE_OF_THE_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_THE_LIST_KEY_CALL",
         "sendingMode": "TYPE_SYNC",
         "transaction": {
             "voteSubmission": {
                 "proposalId": "eb2d3902fdda9c3eb6e369f2235689b871c7322cf3ab284dde3e9dfc13863a17",
                 "value": "VALUE_YES"
             }
         }
      },
      "id": "request_4"
    }
```
